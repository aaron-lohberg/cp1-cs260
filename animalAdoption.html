      <h1>Want to adopt one of our animals?</h1>
      <p id="AAP">At AY-RON Animals, we believe in motivating people to make a difference in the lives of all animals,
        not just dogs, cats, hamsters and fish. Let happiness back into your heart and reach out to an animal in need. Below are
      all the animals in need of a warm, loving home, roughly 80% of your paycheck in food, and medical procedures:</p>

      <img class="aapic" src="/images/horses.jpg" alt="Horse picture!">
      <p class="betweenAAPics">This is Tyron, Lamar and Kevin. They are brothers and all are recent arrivals to our facilities! We found them safely
      stored on our competitor's property and made them disappear, like a magic trick! They eat grass - not dirt, for those curious - they also drink a
      small glass of wine on the weekends, for the antioxidants.</p>
      <img class="aapic" src="/images/turtle.jpg" alt="Turtle picture!">
      <p class="betweenAAPics">Meet Birtle, the 45lb cuddleable turtle we found in the ocean last week! His hobbies include: swimming,
      eating, sleeping, slowly struggling to move 2 feet and sleeping. What kid wouldn't love to have Birtle in their home?
    He's loads of fun! If you're persistent, he'll probably learn at least 0 tricks in his lifetime!</p>
      <img class="aapic" src="/images/dove.jpg" alt="Dove picture!">
      <p class="betweenAAPics">If you couldn't tell from the picture, it's a bird! We didn't care to give it a name, which means it's
      100% new if you purchase it (<i>additional fees may apply</i>) and you can give it your own name that it will likely never learn!
    Warning: does not taste like chicken.</p>
